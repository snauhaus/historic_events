# historic_events
This repository offers a reusable, large data set of historic human events. Most of the events contained herein come from a Wikipedia corpus, and many additional events were manually inputted by myself (Nolan Hemmatazad). A large amount of work was put into manually verifying the accuracy of the events, but as a solitary contributor, the amount of verification likely barely scratches 10% of the overall data set.

# Give a Little Bit?
If you find this data set to be useful, or just think it's cool that it was put out there, please consider donating to the Tuvalie Kickstarter campaign at [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1681169925/tuvalie](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1681169925/tuvalie). Even a pledge of $1 would mean a lot!

# Formatting Details
The historic_events.tsv file contains all data set events. Each event is presented as a line of its own, and in 4 distinct pieces (tab-separated values):

1.  The year of the event

2.  The type of event it was (where 1 = a general event, 2 = birth of a historic figure, and 3 = death of a historic figure)

3.  The month and day of the event (e.g., January 1) or _circa_, if a precise date is not known

4.  The event text, which may lead with a date range such as (February 1 - February 10) for an entry that begins an event spanning multiple days. The event text may also contain italicized items, represented like [i]this[/i]
